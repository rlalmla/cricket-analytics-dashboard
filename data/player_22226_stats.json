    "bio": "Amanjot Kaur, a seam-bowling all-rounder from Punjab, didn\u2019t waste any time in showing the world she was ready for the big-stage after scoring a Player of the Match worthy 41* off 30 on her T20I debut against South Africa in 2023. Just a few months later, she owned the stage once more during her ODI debut after picking up 4/31 against Bangladesh. She started training under Nagesh Gupta as a 17-year old and started playing domestic cricket for Punjab shortly thereafter. In pursuit of more opportunities, she switched to Chandigarh for a couple of seasons before eventually switching back. She was picked up by the Mumbai Indians for INR 50 lakh in the inaugural season of the WPL and was retained thereafter.  <br/>  <br/> <i>\u201cHum bane hi udne ke liye hain\u201d</i> (I am born to fly) she would go on to say after a stunning and game-changing performance in WPL 2025. In a game against RCB, Amanjot first picked 3 wickets before leading her side to a nail-biting win with the bat, scoring 34* off 30,  which would eventually earn her her first Player of the Match award in the WPL.
